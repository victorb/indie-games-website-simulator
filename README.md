Game idea:

Indie Games Website Simulator (Itch-in-a-box)

You are the CTO at a small website/platform that serves indie games. You job is to make sure the infrastructure and software can handle the load at any times. The more dropped requests you end up with, the more angry the people become.

You can add more servers, but then you also need load balancing. Deploying software updates takes time and make servers unavailable.
